# API-call
This was my first attempt at learning and implementing how to use APIs and inject data into the UI. The task here was to fetch data from an API and inject the image URL and Title properties from the API-response array into a card layout.

## Things I learnt:
* Calling an API and fetching data from it (Using fetch web API).
* Converting the API response into JSON and injecting it into the UI.
